The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld 
access to the abortion pill mifepristone. 
The ruling was a win for proponents of 
access to abortion, but laws surrounding 
access in states vary. 

The Food and Drug Administration approved 
mifepristone in 2000 for medication abortion. 
In 2016, it extended the time frame in which 
a pregnant woman can use the drug to terminate 
a pregnancy, from seven weeksâ€™ gestation to 10. 
In 2021, it moved to permanently allow access 
to mifepristone prescriptions via telehealth 
and for the medication to be dispensed by 
pharmacists and mail-order pharmacies.
